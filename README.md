# C++ Ray Tracer (In Progress)
A ray tracer written in modern C++ with planned features including:
- Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH) for acceleration
- Recursive reflections
- Multithreading for performance

---

## Warm-up and Ray Tracing Exercises
COMPLETED a set of smaller excercises to get more comfortable with:
- Memory management (RAII, smart pointers)
- Multithreading
- File I/O
- Vector math (dot/cross products)

These are collected under `examples/` and serve as the foundation for the main project.

---

## Implementation
Started Working on the main ray tracer:
- Implemented core classes: Vec3, Ray, Sphere.
- Preparing to render scenes with colored spheres and output to `.ppm` images.
- Will add shading, reflections, multiple object interaction, and scenes.

Progress can be checked under `src/`
