# C++ Ray Tracer (In Progress)
A ray tracer written in modern C++ with planned features including:
- Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH) for acceleration
- Recursive reflections
- Multithreading for performance

---

## Warm-up and Ray Tracing Exercises
Currently building smaller excercises to get more comfortable with:
- Memory management (RAII, smart pointers)
- Multithreading
- File I/O
- Vector math (dot/cross products)

These are collected under `examples/` and serve as the foundation for the main project.
